Description: 
An Arduino program that uses a joystick to navigate around a map of Edmonton. When the joystick is pressed the screen changes to the 20 closeset restaurants to where the cursor was located on the map. User can the select a restaurant and will return to that restaurant on the map. Tapping the screen will then show all of the restaurants that are located near (Blue dots). 

Two buttons are implemented to let the user select which rating (1-5 stars) restaurants they want to see, and also a button to decide which sorting algorithm they want to run (insertion or quick).
Running time for the algorithms are printed in the serial monitor.
